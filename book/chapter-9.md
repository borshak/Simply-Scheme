Chapter 9

Lambda

Alonzo Church 
inventor of lambda calculus

Let's say we want to add three to each of the numbers in a sentence. Using the tools from Chapter 8, we would do it like this:

(define (add-three number)
  (+ number 3))

(define (add-three-to-each sent)
  (every add-three sent))

> (add-three-to-each '(1 9 9 2))
(4 12 12 5)
It's slightly annoying to have to define a helper procedure add-three just so we can use it as the argument to every. We're never going to use that procedure again, but we still have to come up with a name for it. We'd like a general way to say "here's the function I want you to use" without having to give the procedure a name. In other words, we want a general-purpose procedure-generating procedure!

Lambda is the name of a special form that generates procedures. It takes some information about the function you want to create as arguments and it returns the procedure. It'll be easier to explain the details after you see an example.

(define (add-three-to-each sent)
  (every (lambda (number) (+ number 3)) sent))

> (add-three-to-each '(1 9 9 2))
(4 12 12 5)
The first argument to every is, in effect, the same procedure as the one we called add-three earlier, but now we can use it without giving it a name. (Don't make the mistake of thinking that lambda is the argument to every. The argument is the procedure returned by lambda.)

Perhaps you're wondering whether "lambda" spells something backward. Actually, it's the name of the Greek letter L, which looks like this: Î». It would probably be more sensible if lambda were named something like make-procedure, but the name lambda is traditional.[1]

Creating a procedure by using lambda is very much like creating one with define, as we've done up to this point, except that we don't specify a name. When we create a procedure with define, we have to indicate the procedure's name, the names of its arguments (i.e., the formal parameters), and the expression that it computes (its body). With lambda we still provide the last two of these three components.

As we said, lambda is a special form. This means, as you remember, that its arguments are not evaluated when you invoke it. The first argument is a sentence containing the formal parameters; the second argument is the body. What lambda returns is an unnamed procedure. You can invoke that procedure:

> ((lambda (a b) (+ (* 2 a) b)) 5 6)
16

> ((lambda (wd) (word (last wd) (first wd))) 'impish)
HI
In real life, though, you're not likely to create a procedure with lambda merely to invoke it once. More often, we use lambda as in the first example in this chapter, to provide a procedure as argument to a higher-order function. Here are some more examples:

> (every (lambda (wd) (se (first wd) wd (last wd)))
         '(only a northern song))
(O ONLY Y A A A N NORTHERN N S SONG G)

> (keep (lambda (n) (member? 9 n)) '(4 81 909 781 1969 1776))
(909 1969)

> (accumulate (lambda (this that)
                (if (> (count this) (count that)) this that))
              '(wild honey pie))
HONEY

> (keep (lambda (person) (member? person '(john paul george ringo)))
        '(mick smokey paul diana bill geddy john yoko keith reparata))
(PAUL JOHN)

> (keep (lambda (person) (member? 'e person))
        '(mick smokey paul diana bill geddy john yoko keith reparata))
(SMOKEY GEDDY KEITH REPARATA)
Procedures That Return Procedures

An even more powerful use of lambda is to provide the value returned by some procedure that you write. Here's the classic example:

(define (make-adder num)
  (lambda (x) (+ x num)))

> ((make-adder 4) 7)
11

> (every (make-adder 6) '(2 4 8))
(8 10 14)
The value of the expression (make-adder 4) is a procedure, not a number. That unnamed procedure is the one that adds 4 to its argument. We can understand this by applying the substitution model to make-adder. We substitute 4 for num in the body of make-adder; we end up with

(lambda (x) (+ x 4))
and then we evaluate that expression to get the desired procedure.

Here's a procedure whose argument is a procedure:

(define (same-arg-twice fn)
  (lambda (arg) (fn arg arg)))

> ((same-arg-twice word) 'hello)
HELLOHELLO

> ((same-arg-twice *) 4)
16
When we evaluate (same-arg-twice word) we substitute the procedure word for the formal parameter fn, and the result is

(lambda (arg) (word arg arg))
One more example:

(define (flip fn)
  (lambda (a b) (fn b a)))

> ((flip -) 5 8)
3

> ((flip se) 'goodbye 'hello)
(HELLO GOODBYE)
The Truth about Define

Remember how we said that creating a procedure with lambda was a lot like creating a procedure with define? That's because the notation we've been using with define is an abbreviation that combines two activities: creating a procedure and giving a name to something.

As you saw in Chapter 7, define's real job is to give a name to some value:

> (define pi 3.141592654)

> (* pi 10)
31.41592654

> (define drummer '(ringo starr))

> (first drummer)
RINGO
When we say

(define (square x) (* x x))
it's actually an abbreviation for

(define square (lambda (x) (* x x)))
In this example, the job of lambda is to create a procedure that multiplies its argument by itself; the job of define is to name that procedure square.

In the past, without quite saying so, we've talked as if the name of a procedure were understood differently from other names in a program. In thinking about an expression such as

(* x x)
we've talked about substituting some actual value for the x but took the * for granted as meaning the multiplication function.

The truth is that we have to substitute a value for the * just as we do for the x. It just happens that * has been predefined to have the multiplication procedure as its value. This definition of * is global, like the definition of pi above. "Global" means that it's not a formal parameter of a procedure, like x in square, but has a permanent value established by define.

When an expression is evaluated, every name in the expression must have some value substituted for it. If the name is a formal parameter, then the corresponding actual argument value is substituted. Otherwise, the name had better have a global definition, and that value is substituted. It just so happens that Scheme has predefined a zillion names before you start working, and most of those are names of primitive procedures.

(By the way, this explains why when you make a typing mistake in the name of a procedure you might see an error message that refers to variables, such as "variable frist not bound." You might expect it to say "frist is not a procedure," but the problem is no different from that of any other name that has no associated value.)

Now that we know the whole truth about define, we can use it in combination with the function-creating functions in these past two chapters.

> (define square (same-arg-twice *))

> (square 7)
49

> (define fourth-power (repeated square 2))

> (fourth-power 5)
625
The Truth about Let

In Chapter 7 we introduced let as an abbreviation for the situation in which we would otherwise define a helper procedure in order to give names to commonly-used values in a calculation. We started with

(define (roots a b c)
  (roots1 a b c (sqrt (- (* b b) (* 4 a c)))))

(define (roots1 a b c discriminant)
  (se (/ (+ (- b) discriminant) (* 2 a))
      (/ (- (- b) discriminant) (* 2 a))))
and introduced the new notation

(define (roots a b c)
  (let ((discriminant (sqrt (- (* b b) (* 4 a c)))))
    (se (/ (+ (- b) discriminant) (* 2 a))
        (/ (- (- b) discriminant) (* 2 a)))))
to avoid creating an otherwise-useless named procedure. But now that we know about unnamed procedures, we can see that let is merely an abbreviation for creating and invoking an anonymous procedure:

(define (roots a b c)
  ((lambda (discriminant)
     (se (/ (+ (- b) discriminant) (* 2 a))
         (/ (- (- b) discriminant) (* 2 a))))
   (sqrt (- (* b b) (* 4 a c)))))
What's shown in boldface above is the part that invokes the procedure created by the lambda, including the actual argument expression.

Just as the notation to define a procedure with parentheses around its name is an abbreviation for a define and a lambda, the let notation is an abbreviation for a lambda and an invocation.

Name Conflicts

When a procedure is created inside another procedure, what happens if you use the same formal parameter name in both?

(define (f x)
  (lambda (x) (+ x 3)))
Answer: Don't do it.

What actually happens is that the inner x wins; that's the one that is substituted into the body. But if you find yourself in this situation, you are almost certainly doing something wrong, such as using nondescriptive names like x for your variables.

Named and Unnamed Functions

Although you've been running across the idea of function since high school algebra, you've probably never seen an unnamed function until now. The high school function notation, g(x)=3x+8, requires you to give the function a name (g in this case) when you create it. Most of the functions you know, both in math and in programming, have names, such as logarithm or first.[2]

When do you want to name a function, and when not? It may help to think about an analogy with numbers. Imagine if every Scheme number had to have a name before you could use it. You'd have to say

> (define three 3)
> (define four 4)
> (+ three four)
7
This is analogous to the way we've dealt with procedures until now, giving each one a name. Sometimes it's much easier to use a number directly, and it's silly to have to give it a name.

But sometimes it isn't silly. A common example that we've seen earlier is

(define pi 3.141592654)

(define (circle-area radius)
  (* pi radius radius))

(define (circumference radius)
  (* 2 pi radius))

(define (sphere-surface-area radius)
  (* 4 pi radius radius))                                

(define (sphere-volume radius)
  (* (/ 4 3) pi radius radius radius))
If we couldn't give a name to the number 3.141592654, then we'd have to type it over and over again. Apart from the extra typing, our programs would be harder to read and understand. Giving Ï a name makes the procedures more self-documenting. (That is, someone else who reads our procedures will have an easier time understanding what we meant.)

It's the same with procedures. If we're going to use a procedure more than once, and if there's a meaningful name for it that will help clarify the program, then we define the procedure with define and give it a name.

(define (square x) (* x x))
Square deserves a name both because we use it often and because there is a good traditional name for it that everyone understands. More important, by giving square a name, we are shifting attention from the process by which it works (invoking the multiplication procedure) to its purpose, computing the square of a number. From now on we can think about squaring as though it were a Scheme primitive. This idea of naming something and forgetting the details of its implementation is what we've been calling "abstraction."

On the other hand, if we have an unimportant procedure that we're using only once, we might as well create it with lambda and without a name.

> (every (lambda (x) (last (bl x))) '(all together now))
(L E O)
We could have defined this procedure with the name next-to-last, but if we're never going to use it again, why bother?

Here's an example in which we use an obscure unnamed function to help us define one that's worth naming:

(define (backwards wd) (accumulate (lambda (a b) (word b a)) wd))

> (backwards 'yesterday)
YADRETSEY

> (every backwards '(i saw her standing there))
(I WAS REH GNIDNATS EREHT)
Pitfalls

It's very convenient that define has an abbreviated form to define a procedure using a hidden lambda, but because there are two notations that differ only subtlyâone has an extra set of parenthesesâyou could use the wrong one by mistake. If you say

(define (pi) 3.141592654)
you're not defining a variable whose value is a number. Instead the value of pi will be a procedure. It would then be an error to say

(* 2 pi)
When should the body of your procedure be a lambda expression? It's easy to go overboard and say "I'm writing a procedure so I guess I need lambda" even when the procedure is supposed to return a word.

The secret is to remember the ideas of domain and range that we talked about in Chapter 2. What is the range of the function you're writing? Should it return a procedure? If so, its body might be a lambda expression. (It might instead be an invocation of a higher-order procedure, such as repeated, that returns a procedure.) If your procedure doesn't return a procedure, its body won't be a lambda expression. (Of course your procedure might still use a lambda expression as an argument to some other procedure, such as every.)

For example, here is a procedure to keep the words of a sentence that contain the letter h. The domain of the function is sentences, and its range is also sentences. (That is, it takes a sentence as argument and returns a sentence as its value.)

(define (keep-h sent)
  (keep (lambda (wd) (member? 'h wd)) sent))
By contrast, here is a function of a letter that returns a procedure to keep words containing that letter.

(define (keeper letter)
  (lambda (sent)
    (keep (lambda (wd) (member? letter wd)) sent)))
The procedure keeper has letters as its domain and procedures as its range. The procedure returned by keeper has sentences as its domain and as its range, just as keep-h does. In fact, we can use keeper to define keep-h:

(define keep-h (keeper 'h))
Don't confuse the creation of a procedure with the invocation of one. Lambda creates a procedure. The procedure is invoked in response to an expression whose first subexpression represents that procedure. That is, the first subexpression could be the name of the procedure, or it could be a lambda expression if you want to create a procedure and invoke it right away:

((lambda (x) (+ x 3)) 6)
In particular, when you create a procedure, you specify its formal parametersâthe names for its arguments. When you invoke the procedure, you specify values for those arguments. (In this example, the lambda expression includes the formal parameter x, but the invocation provides the actual argument 6.)

Real Exercises

9.4  The following program doesn't work. Why not? Fix it.

(define (who sent)
  (every describe '(pete roger john keith)))

(define (describe person)
  (se person sent))
It's supposed to work like this:

> (who '(sells out))
(pete sells out roger sells out john sells out keith sells out)
In each of the following exercises, write the procedure in terms of lambda and higher-order functions. Do not use named helper procedures. If you've read Part IV, don't use recursion, either.

9.5  Write prepend-every:

> (prepend-every 's '(he aid he aid))
(SHE SAID SHE SAID)

> (prepend-every 'anti '(dote pasto gone body))
(ANTIDOTE ANTIPASTO ANTIGONE ANTIBODY)
9.6  Write a procedure sentence-version that takes a function f as its argument and returns a function g. f should take a single word as argument. g should take a sentence as argument and return the sentence formed by applying f to each word of that argument.

> ((sentence-version first) '(if i fell))
(I I F)

> ((sentence-version square) '(8 2 4 6))
(64 4 16 36)
9.7  Write a procedure called letterwords that takes as its arguments a letter and a sentence. It returns a sentence containing only those words from the argument sentence that contain the argument letter:

(GOT TO YOU INTO)
9.8  Suppose we're writing a program to play hangman. In this game one player has to guess a secret word chosen by the other player, one letter at a time. You're going to write just one small part of this program: a procedure that takes as arguments the secret word and the letters guessed so far, returning the word in which the guessing progress is displayed by including all the guessed letters along with underscores for the not-yet-guessed ones:

> (hang 'potsticker 'etaoi)
_OT_TI__E_
Hint: You'll find it helpful to use the following procedure that determines how to display a single letter:

(define (hang-letter letter guesses)
  (if (member? letter guesses)
      letter
      '_))
9.9  Write a procedure common-words that takes two sentences as arguments and returns a sentence containing only those words that appear both in the first sentence and in the second sentence.

9.10  In Chapter 2 we used a function called appearances that returns the number of times its first argument appears as a member of its second argument. Implement appearances.

9.11  Write a procedure unabbrev that takes two sentences as arguments. It should return a sentence that's the same as the first sentence, except that any numbers in the original sentence should be replaced with words from the second sentence. A number 2 in the first sentence should be replaced with the second word of the second sentence, a 6 with the sixth word, and so on.

> (unabbrev '(john 1 wayne fred 4) '(bill hank kermit joey))
(JOHN BILL WAYNE FRED JOEY)

> (unabbrev '(i 3 4 tell 2) '(do you want to know a secret?))
(I WANT TO TELL YOU)
9.12  Write a procedure first-last whose argument will be a sentence. It should return a sentence containing only those words in the argument sentence whose first and last letters are the same:

> (first-last '(california ohio nebraska alabama alaska massachusetts))
(OHIO ALABAMA ALASKA)
9.13  Write a procedure compose that takes two functions f and g as arguments. It should return a new function, the composition of its input functions, which computes f(g(x)) when passed the argument x.

> ((compose sqrt abs) -25)
5

> (define second (compose first bf))

> (second '(higher order function))
ORDER
9.14  Write a procedure substitute that takes three arguments, two words and a sentence. It should return a version of the sentence, but with every instance of the second word replaced with the first word:

> (substitute 'maybe 'yeah '(she loves you yeah yeah yeah))
(SHE LOVES YOU MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE)
9.15  Many functions are applicable only to arguments in a certain domain and result in error messages if given arguments outside that domain. For example, sqrt may require a nonnegative argument in a version of Scheme that doesn't include complex numbers. (In any version of Scheme, sqrt will complain if its argument isn't a number at all!) Once a program gets an error message, it's impossible for that program to continue the computation.

Write a procedure type-check that takes as arguments a one-argument procedure f and a one-argument predicate procedure pred. Type-check should return a one-argument procedure that first applies pred to its argument; if that result is true, the procedure should return the value computed by applying f to the argument; if pred returns false, the new procedure should also return #f:

> (define safe-sqrt (type-check sqrt number?))

> (safe-sqrt 16)
4

> (safe-sqrt 'sarsaparilla)
#F
9.16  In the language APL, most arithmetic functions can be applied either to a number, with the usual result, or to a vectorâthe APL name for a sentence of numbersâin which case the result is a new vector in which each element is the result of applying the function to the corresponding element of the argument. For example, the function sqrt applied to 16 returns 4 as in Scheme, but sqrt can also be applied to a sentence such as (16 49) and it returns (4 7).

Write a procedure aplize that takes as its argument a one-argument procedure whose domain is numbers or words. It should return an APLized procedure that also accepts sentences:

> (define apl-sqrt (aplize sqrt))

> (apl-sqrt 36)
6

> (apl-sqrt '(1 100 25 16))
(1 10 5 4)
9.17  Write keep in terms of every and accumulate.

[1] It comes from a branch of mathematical logic called "lambda calculus" that's about the formal properties of functions. The inclusion of first-class functions in Lisp was inspired by this mathematical work, so Lisp borrowed the name lambda.
[2] Professional mathematicians do have a notation for unnamed functions, by the way. They write (x â¦ 3x+8).
